## 0.0.1

Initial public release. Adds features to Ambient Lights in a scene:

- User can configure a light border to be triangle, square, hexagon, or none. (Default remains circle.)
- User can configure wall ids from the scene to a cache in the light; the light will continue to act as if those walls are present even if they are later removed.
- User can press button to capture selected walls, adding them as the cached wall ids.
