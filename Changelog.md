## 0.8.2
Improve performance for token animation after a drag operation. Addresses #20.

## 0.8.1
Fix for scene not loading due to errors with rendering cached walls when Elevation Ruler v0.10.12 is active.

## 0.8.0
Update to FoundryVTT v12 compatibility. Adds a tab dedicated to Light/Mask in the new v12 App v2 windows for lighting and sound configuration. Uses v12's new canvas edges feature to implement wall caching.

### KNOWN ISSUES
- Token lighting shapes are getting applied but are overridden by the token circle lighting.
- Sound configuration no longer previews the sound. (Previewing was not a core Foundry feature in v11 nor v12 but was added by this module in v11.)
- When using relative walls, dragging the light can result in what seems to be temporary glitches in the lighting shape. Usually this resolves when the drag ends, but it can be fixed by reopening the ambient light config, reloading the scene, or possibly otherwise causing a lighting refresh.

## 0.7.5
Fix for sound not following the token when attached until going back to the sound controls layer. Issue #17.

## 0.7.4
Fix for incompatibiity with Sound of Token and Token Attacher. Issues #16 and #17.

## 0.7.3
Force source update so that changes reflect in the placeable without moving the mouse. Force radius update when creating the preview. Closes issue #15.
Refactor to use Patcher class.
Update geometry lib to v0.2.12.

## 0.7.2
Update geometry lib to v0.2.2.

## 0.7.1
Update geometry lib to v0.2.1.

## 0.7.0
Updated for v11. Update geometry lib to v0.2.0.

## 0.6.6
Update geometry lib to v0.1.5.

## 0.6.5
Update geometry lib to v0.1.4.

## 0.6.4
Fix for issue #14 (Drag Ruler pathfinding).

## 0.6.3
Update geometry lib to v0.1.3.

## 0.6.2
Update geometry lib to v0.1.1.

## 0.6.1
Add a shared geometry git submodule.
Fix for prototype token error on save (issue #13). (Appears to be caused by a workaround for a Foundry bug that has since been addressed.)

## 0.6.0
Refactor the configuration settings to use css "display:none," which is simpler than the previous approach for hiding/displaying sub-settings when a specific shape is chosen.

Fix issue #12 (token invisibility gets "stuck").

## 0.5.2
Add v9 compatible tags (not v9 compatible, just to eliminate errors with module updating).
Updates for v10 stable.

## 0.5.1
Change "name" to "id" in module.json.

## 0.5.0
Foundry v10 version! Major rewrite to accommodate improvements to v10 ClockwiseSweep, data model, and sound/lighting. As a result, not compatible with v9.
- No longer overrides the Foundry sweep methodology, which should improve compatibility and results in much less code to upkeep.
- Improved Weiler-Atherton clipping methodology for faster intersects of a polygon with convex polygon shapes, circles, and ellipses.
- New classes to handle different types of regular polygons and ellipses.

## 0.4.1
Fix for [issue #11](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/11). Avoid console errors when selecting modules in the Module Config screen.

## 0.4.0
Switch to better approach for injecting Light Mask settings into the light/sound configuration applications. This should greatly improve compatibility with other modules that might modify the light/sound configuration.

Setting the prototype token and world default token settings for Light Mask should now work properly. Removes the wall cache parameters when configuring a prototype token or default token because those must be set at a per-scene level for a given token.

Sound and Token configurations now refresh instantaneously when changing the parameters of a sound or light shape, respectively.

## 0.3.6
Fix when caching walls relative to a token, to prevent the walls from "shifting". Fixes [issue #10](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/10)

## 0.3.5
Fix to catching multiple walls with unlimited vision (fix bounding box issues).

## 0.3.4
Fix to re-enable catching walls for light sources. (Accidentally borked in 0.3 series.)

## 0.3.3
Add option to use ellipses.

## 0.3.2
- Incorporate improvements from Walled Templates v0.3.0.
- Added localization to settings.

## 0.3.1
- Do not overwrite the origin object to improve compatibility with Wall Height. Fixes [issue #9](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/9).
- Use Cohen-Sutherland approach to classifying zones around a rectangle to improve segment intersection identification.

## 0.3.0
Can now select shapes for token lighting.
- Simplify how Sweep algorithm uses methods from the source object to retrieve the boundaryPolygon and any temporary edges.

## 0.2.4
Fix [issue #8](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/8). Points/Sides no longer hidden until shape changed.

## 0.2.3
Fix rendering error when using a limited angle close to 360ยบ. Fixes [issue #6](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/6) (redux).

## 0.2.2
Fix conflict with PerfectVision by switching ClipperLib to an internal-only import.

## 0.2.1
Fix conflict with walled template where both modules define the same getters.

## 0.2.0
Relies on a version of ClockwiseSweep that can accept arbitrary boundary polygons and temporary walls. Fixes [issue #6](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/6).
- User can now specify any regular polygon with 3+ sides.
- User can now specify any star-shaped polygon with 5+ sides.
- Improvements to the UI/UX when selected shape types in the light and sound configurations to prevent the UI from jumping around on refresh.
- Add option to use the new ClockwiseSweep algorithm for all vision/lighting/sound for advanced users and testing.

## 0.1.2
Add checkbox to light/sound configuration that lets the user make the cached walls move relative to the light/sound object (closes #1). Fix storing of cached wall and relative origin data to the database so it remains after logging out and back in to Foundry (closes #3). Add a `canvasReady` hook to refresh the lights and sounds on first canvas load to avoid Foundry issue [#6227](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6227) and allow lights/sounds with cached walls to draw properly.

## 0.1.1
Fix potential bug when using limited angle lights or sounds.

## 0.1.0
Require Foundry 9.233 to avoid wall selection issues with 9.232.

## 0.0.4
Added equivalent geometric shapes and custom walls for sound objects. Switched to using templates to render the object configuration additions and added localization.

## 0.0.3
Updated for Foundry v9.232 (Testing 1).
- Use `config.source` instead of searching for light by id
- Update `identifyEdges`, particularly the canvas boundary creation
- Change size of the geometry to be slightly smaller than radius to avoid light-leakage issues.

## 0.0.2
Add pentagon, pentagram, and hexagram geometries. Align geometries to the grid when rotation is set to the default of 0.

## 0.0.1

Initial public release. Adds features to Ambient Lights in a scene:

- User can configure a light border to be triangle, square, hexagon, or none. (Default remains circle.)
- User can configure wall ids from the scene to a cache in the light; the light will continue to act as if those walls are present even if they are later removed.
- User can press button to capture selected walls, adding them as the cached wall ids.
