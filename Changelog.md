## 0.2.4
Fix [issue #8](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/8). Points/Sides no longer hidden until shape changed.

## 0.2.3
Fix rendering error when using a limited angle close to 360ยบ. Fixes [issue #6](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/6) (redux).

## 0.2.2
Fix conflict with PerfectVision by switching ClipperLib to an internal-only import.

## 0.2.1
Fix conflict with walled template where both modules define the same getters.

## 0.2.0
Relies on a version of ClockwiseSweep that can accept arbitrary boundary polygons and temporary walls. Fixes [issue #6](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-light-mask/issues/6).
- User can now specify any regular polygon with 3+ sides.
- User can now specify any star-shaped polygon with 5+ sides.
- Improvements to the UI/UX when selected shape types in the light and sound configurations to prevent the UI from jumping around on refresh.
- Add option to use the new ClockwiseSweep algorithm for all vision/lighting/sound for advanced users and testing.

## 0.1.2
Add checkbox to light/sound configuration that lets the user make the cached walls move relative to the light/sound object (closes #1). Fix storing of cached wall and relative origin data to the database so it remains after logging out and back in to Foundry (closes #3). Add a `canvasReady` hook to refresh the lights and sounds on first canvas load to avoid Foundry issue [#6227](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/foundryvtt/-/issues/6227) and allow lights/sounds with cached walls to draw properly.

## 0.1.1
Fix potential bug when using limited angle lights or sounds.

## 0.1.0
Require Foundry 9.233 to avoid wall selection issues with 9.232.

## 0.0.4
Added equivalent geometric shapes and custom walls for sound objects. Switched to using templates to render the object configuration additions and added localization.

## 0.0.3
Updated for Foundry v9.232 (Testing 1).
- Use `config.source` instead of searching for light by id
- Update `identifyEdges`, particularly the canvas boundary creation
- Change size of the geometry to be slightly smaller than radius to avoid light-leakage issues.

## 0.0.2
Add pentagon, pentagram, and hexagram geometries. Align geometries to the grid when rotation is set to the default of 0.

## 0.0.1

Initial public release. Adds features to Ambient Lights in a scene:

- User can configure a light border to be triangle, square, hexagon, or none. (Default remains circle.)
- User can configure wall ids from the scene to a cache in the light; the light will continue to act as if those walls are present even if they are later removed.
- User can press button to capture selected walls, adding them as the cached wall ids.
